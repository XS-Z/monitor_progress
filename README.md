# monitor_progress

This is a sample project that monitoring progress of much-time-cost tasks. For example: downloading file.

All files listed in this project contain only key code snippets, so you can't run it immediately after clone to local. But I think that is enouth to inspire you smart guys. :)

In case anyone who don't want to review code line by line, you can check it out below brief introduction.

1. Besides existing codes/requests, the page generate one more request (via websockets) to server. When server recieve that request, it keep informing client(page) after every time interval till the task complete. 
2. Tutirial: [Getting Started with SignalR 2 and MVC 5](http://www.asp.net/signalr/overview/getting-started/tutorial-getting-started-with-signalr-and-mvc) 
3. Technoligy stack: ASP.NET MVC 5, SignalR, websockets
4. Some improvements can be done as I comment inline.
